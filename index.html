                <section>Imagine that you're Patrick with a clone gun that wants to make a Krabby Patty.</section>
                <section>With your low intellect, you try to recreate the Krabby Patty through experiments</section>
                <section>The first thing you have to do is place the back bread on the table, but you're Patrick. So you placed ketchup instead</section>
                <section>You thought it's the right choice, so you get a container and cloned the ketchup inside it.</section>
                <section>But then, you realize that it was wrong and you replaced the ketchup with a panda.</section>
                <section>You thought it's the right choice, so you get another container, placed it on top of the other container from before and cloned the panda on the second container.</section>
                <section>You basically, do the same step until you are satisfied. But you're Patrick, so you never are finished.</section>
                <section>Now here comes Larry, and he wants to make a Krabby Patty with you. So he borrows your clone gun clones the latest container to his table. And you guys do the same steps all over again.</section>
